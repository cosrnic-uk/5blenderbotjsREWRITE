# 5blenderbotjsREWRITE

5BlenderBot is a bot created for [@5Blender](https://twitter.com/5blender)'s discord server. The bot is coded in JS using Discord.JS v14.

This is a rewrite of the older bot I created which was running Discord.JS v13.

The bot is still in development and is entirely done by myself.

Want to read the code? well all of it is in the `src` folder!

Host Requirements:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [or another alternative!]
- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Basic understanding of JS and Discord

How to host:
- First download the zip by clicking the download button
- Then extract the zip
- Then open the folder in something like Visual Studio Code
- Then open a new terminal and type "npm install"
- Then make a file called `.env` in the main folder [not `src` folder!]
- Then type `TOKEN=` and add your bots token after `TOKEN=`
- Then on a new line type `MONGO_LOGIN=` and add your mongo URL after `MONGO_LOGIN=`
- Then type `npm run test`
